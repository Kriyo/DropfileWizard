### Additional Information about UI and UX Components:
#### Framework
The Front end framework used is Angular Material Design:
https://material.angularjs.org/latest/#/

This is a fantastic framework to use, it provided a great time saving along with a modern approach to web application in both, design and behaviour.

#### Color Scheme
The color scheme is replicated from the mock ups from Applix that I found on the forge. I decided to keep things consistent.
This can be swapped relatively easy to something else by modifying and existing color palette:
